# Linux Privilege Escalation
#### Luke Rindels - April 2019

## Introduction
Initial exploitation of a machine usually involves gaining access to a
low-privileged user. That's great and a lot of information can be gleaned from
a user account, but higher levels of access allow for complete ownership of a
machine. In this lab you will be given credentials for a very low level user
on a docker container. From the low level user you will be able to elevate your
privileges to higher levels of privilege by exploiting poorly setup systems. 
Hopefully learning about how attackers elevate privileges you will be better
prepared to harden a system in the future.
